Steps to run the PokeDex Api:

1.- Follow the setup steps explained in the following link: https://github.com/ARivas16/pokedex

2.- After installing all dependencies, run the following command to start the server: rails s

3.- Once the server is up and ready, open up a Web browser and search: "http://localhost:3000", 
    to connect to it.
	
4.- Operate the PokeDex normally, as the changes were made without altering the functionality of the API.
